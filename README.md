# Binary-Tree-Search
The goal of this programming assignment was to create a program that read in a file and put 1000 names into a binary search tree. The program is to then loop until the user inputs “quit”, and the loop allows the user to continuously search for a name in the tree. The program will output the whether the name was found and if it was it will output additional information about it.
